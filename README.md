## Project Overview

This AI-powered water resource management platform demonstrates my passion for solving critical challenges in Africa using cutting-edge technology. The system provides real-time monitoring, predictive analytics, and AI-driven insights to help water management authorities make data-driven decisions.

### The Challenge

Africa faces significant water management challenges:
- 400 million people lack access to basic drinking water
- 40% of the population affected by water scarcity
- Limited infrastructure for water quality monitoring
- Inefficient resource allocation and distribution

### The Solution

I developed an intelligent platform that:
- Monitors water quality parameters in real-time
- Predicts potential issues before they occur
- Provides actionable insights for resource optimization
- Makes complex data accessible to all stakeholders

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- **State Management**: React Context API for efficient state handling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and maintainable design
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for interactive and real-time charts
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
